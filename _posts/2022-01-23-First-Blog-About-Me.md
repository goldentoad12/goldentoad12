*That's me!!*

## A Little About Me

My name is Matthew and I am currently a junior at CNU. I am pursing a bachelors degree in biology and hope to one day become a forensic pathologist. The pronouns I commonly  go by are he/they; however, any pronouns would work I'm not too particular on any which one. Im taking a digital humanities course this semester and hence, the reason that im writing this blog. I choose to take this class as I find this new realm of humanties to be very interesting as it combines a new and old world ideas, not to mention it helps fulfill my WI requirement :laughing:.

Im planning on completing my Bachelor's here come 2023 and start to fing work in my chosen career field. I would like to start working in a crime lab out west in order to get my foot into the door. After working there for a few years and getting a better idea for what is to come I would go back to school and start working towards my higher degrees. As previously stated, my end goal woud ultimately be to work as a forensic pathologist, preforming autopsies and other such matters.
