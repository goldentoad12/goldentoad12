# Review: *Witches*

Project: Witches

Project Director(s): Ewan McAndrews

Project URL: <https://witches.is.ed.ac.uk/>

## Summary

Pulling from Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database, *Witches* is an online interactive website that allows its viewers to explore the Scottish region and see where people were accused of being "witches" and some basic information of them. This site provides many different filters ranging from economic class to the job these people had. To add further context, it provides both a modern and historical map to help and identify some places that may no longer be in existence. Many different accessibility options are included ranging from text resizing, voice commands, and keyboard controls.

One glaring issue from its beginning comes with the self-identification of the website. *Witches*, as the name implies, gives historical data and graphic representation on accused witches, with the drawback being that it doesn't explicitly specify the area in which the witches it presents are located. Seeing as people accused of witchcraft come from all over the world, when opening the page only a small section of the world map has the accused marked. It isn't until reaching the reference page that it becomes apparent that the project solely focuses on the people of Scotland. Given access to the entire world map and the non-specificity of the project's intentions, the work can initially be seen as underwhelming in its scope and not entirely completed. 

PUT TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP PIC

The map provided with the project give rise to other problems with accesibility and ease of viewing. The modern day map provided does provide legible and distinct from the background; however, the same can't be said for the historical map provided. It is a topographical map, most likely from the late 1800s (not specificaly specified), that has very muted colors for both thw text and the background. The further you zoom in, the worse this problem gets as more lines begin to be put over the words. This causes the map to be illedgebile.
