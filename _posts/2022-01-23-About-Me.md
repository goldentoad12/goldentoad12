*That's me!!*

## A Little About Me

My name is Matthew and I am currently a junior at CNU. I am pursing a bachelors degree in biology and hope to one day become a forensic pathologist. The pronouns I commonly  go by are he/they; however, any pronouns would work I'm not too particular on any which one. Im taking a digital humanities course this semester and hence, the reason that im writing this blog. I choose to take this class as I find this new realm of humanties to be very interesting as it combines a new and old world ideas, not to mention it helps fulfill my WI requirement :laughing:.

## Career Goals

I'm planning on completing my Bachelor's here come 2023 and start to fing work in my chosen career field. I would like to start working in a crime lab out west in order to get my foot into the door. After working there for a few years and getting a better idea for what is to come I would go back to school and start working towards my higher degrees. As previously stated, my end goal woud ultimately be to work as a forensic pathologist, preforming autopsies and other such matters.

## Academic Success ðŸŽ“

In school, I have always excelled. I graduated from highschool with an Advanced Diploma and an IB diploma. Following this, I attended [Thomas Nelson Community College](https://www.tncc.edu/) where I earned my Associates Degree in the social sciences.

## Personal Tidbits

I was born and raised in Newport News and currently live there. I did move to Chesapeake for highschool as my mom had remarried, but we moved back after I graduated high school. I have three animals, two cats and a dog. My cat's names are Whiskers and JJ; my dog's name is skye. In my past-time I love rollerskating, hanging out with my friends, and playing videogames. Currently, I'm playing the Pokemon remakes and am anxiously awaiting for the release of their new game in just a few days!

Now and again, through the black mass of drifting cloud, came a straggling ray of moonlight, which lit up the expanse, and showed me that I was at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew trees. As the snow had ceased to fall, I walked out from the shelter and began to investigate more closely. It appeared to me that, amongst so many old foundations as I had passed, there might be still standing a house in which, though in ruins, I could find some sort of shelter for a while. As I skirted the edge of the copse, I found that a low wall encircled it, and [Page 9]following this I presently found an opening. Here the cypresses formed an alley leading up to a square mass of some kind of building. Just as I caught sight of this, however, the drifting clouds obscured the moon, and I passed up the path in darkness. The wind must have grown colder, for I felt myself shiver as I walked; but there was hope of shelter, and I groped my way blindly on.
	I stopped, for there was a sudden stillness. The storm had passed; and, perhaps in sympathy with natureâ€™s silence, my heard seemed to cease to beat. But this was only momentarily; for suddenly the moonlight broke through the clouds, showing me that I was in a graveyard, and that the square object before me was a great massive tomb of marble, as white as the snow that lay on and all around it. With the moonlight there came a fierce sigh of the storm, which appeared to resume its course with a long, low howl, as of many dogs or wolves. I was awed and shocked, and felt the cold perceptibly grown upon me till it seemed to grip me by the heart. Then while the flood of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb, the storm gave further evidence of renewing, as though it was returning on its track. Impelled by some sort of fascination, I approached the sepulchre to see what it was, and why such a thing stood alone in such a place. I walked around it, and read, over the Doric door, in Germanâ€“
