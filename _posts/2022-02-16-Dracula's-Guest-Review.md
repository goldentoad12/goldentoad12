# Exploring TEI

For this assignment, we were given a small section of the story, “Dracula’s Guest” by Bram Stoker. The section I received were two large paragraphs between pages 8 and 9. In this part, the storm has subsided and the narrator first notices that they are in a graveyard. I used XML (extensive markup language) to markup and analyze the text using the program Oxygen. 

## Google Docs Markup

I would highlight and take note of paragraph beginnings and endings, em-dashes, and other unique parts of the text. My teacher had also included notes for words that needed explanation or whose spelling differed from that of American English. 

## Using Oxygen

For me, oxygen only took me a single class to get everything completely marked up and formatted correctly. My section mostly consisted of using code such as ```<p> </p>``` to denote the beginning and ending of a paragraph. Also, I frequently had to use ```<note> </note>``` as my section consisted of quite a few of those.  When first compiling this code however, it didn’t immediately work. I had introduced some characters that made it fail as well as capitalized words that didn’t need it. This was an easy fix however and didn’t give me too many issues in the long run.

When first going into this project, I found it to be very daunting. I had never done any sort of coding before and my only knowledge of it came from movies. I was initially overwhelmed as I believed myself to be incapable of learning it so quickly. After beginning however, my nerves calmed down. The coding process was straightforward and the way everything was indexed made sense to me. It follows a bullet point method, where instead of bullets you have things like title or body. This made it much easier to follow and learn.

## Final Remarks

From this project I gained a healthy respect and knowledge for TEI and coding. What I learned from this can be later used in my career. I went into this project unsure of coding and came away with a new mindset and appreciation for the field.
