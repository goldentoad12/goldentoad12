## What is Digital Humanities to me

When I first came into this digital humanities class, we were first asked a simple question, “How would you define Digital Humanities.” At first, I was unsure as I had never really known what DH was, but I decided to give it a go and came up with this first definition. 

> Digital humanities is the next step of combining traditional knowledge with the new accessibility and resources provided by the internet. It creates knowledge that is interactive and accessible to more people.

In the beginning, I did find this definition to adequately describe what I believed DH to be. However, as time moved forward and I began to read more about DH and see how people utilize it, I felt as though my old definition no longer represented what I thought. I created a new definition that I believe better fits what I think now, and it goes as follows,

> Digital humanities is an exploration of knowledge and the technologies used to create and document it. DH creates a method to which knowledge is more accessible to everyone regardless of their background while also preserving it for future generations.

Having looked at how my definition has changed; I feel as though I have a better understanding of this field. I understand that DH is different for everyone, but now I can see the common threads that tie most of them together.

## What did I like to do

ADD PICTURE TWITTER LEFT SIDE

One of the aspects of this class that I really enjoyed was the utilization of Twitter. I will admit that for my personal life I am not one for being on social media or posting my ideas to a public forum for that matter. However, using twitter to express my thought or ideas on what we were doing in class was kind of helpful for me. As seen in this picture on the left, I had some concerns about our final grant project. But as I came to find out I wasn’t alone in this worry. My classmates commented and shared how they were struggling in similar manners. I am someone who can be very anxious at times, but this was comforting for me to see. Utilizing Twitter for this class made me feel as though I was part of a community wanting to learn, rather than being a student working towards a grade. 

Another aspect of Twitter that I enjoyed was the access to opposing ideas that I was presented too. In class it can be hard to hear everyone’s opinions due to time constraints. Twitter helped with this by allowing us more time to all have a voice. I was able to see thoughts and opinions that were similar and different to mine. Because of DH’s nature to be different for everyone, I found that this helped me better understand it. 

## Readings

EYE PICTURE RIGHT SIDE

I found the reading we were assigned to be helpful in being both a better writer and a better digital humanist. The reading that I most enjoyed learning about and eventually utilize was that of “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence.” Most of what I have written has been on paper in an essay style format. Up until this class, I had never written anything to be online for everyone to see. Because of this, I had no idea that people’s reading habits change when something is on a screen. This article allowed me to be a better writer when on an online format as well as helped me to identify my flaws when reading something online. I feel as though this reading helped me in this class and will also help me in my future endeavors.

## My Personal Growth

Coming into this class, I believed myself to be a brilliant writer. In some respects, I still believe myself to be, however I realize now that there was so much, I didn’t know. All my life my writing has been academically focused and with that much repetition I became well versed in its creation. Digital Humanities as a field and as a class opened my eyes and made me realize that there is more than that. It pushed me to explore different writing styles and forced me to put myself, or more aptly, my personality, onto the page. This introduction of unfamiliarity has made me grow as both a writer and a student. I feel more confident in my abilities now than I did coming into this class. I believe that there is still much more for me to learn about the digital humanities, but I feel as though my progression as a digital humanist has progressed greatly. I am grateful that I took this class and the knowledge that it provided to me will help me be a better me moving forward.
