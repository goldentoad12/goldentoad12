# Review: *Witches*

*Witches* is an online interactive DH project that allows its viewers to explore accused witches in the Scottish region. It pulls 3,141 results from the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database. These include the basic information of those accused of witchcraft.

This project consists of a large map with clickable icons of "witches" to view information on these individuals. This site provides filters for interacting with these icons; ranging from economic class to occupations. Additionally, it provides both a modern and historical map to identify some places that may no longer be in existence. Trial locations and other involved persons are accessible through other tabs.

## Presentation

One glaring issue from its beginning comes with the self-identification of the website. *Witches* gives historical data and graphic representation on accused witches. Yet it doesn't specify the area in which the witches it presents are. Fears of witchcraft are universal and appear in many cultures. But when opening the page only a small section of the world map has the accused marked. It isn't until reaching the reference page that it becomes clear that the project focuses on the people of Scotland. Having an entire world map and no specification on where the project is. 

### Maps

<br> The map provided with the project give rise to other problems with accessibility and ease of viewing. The modern-day map provided is legible and distinct from the background. However, that isn't the case for the historical map provided. 
<br> The historical map has very muted colors for both the text and the background. The further you zoom in, the worse this problem gets as more lines, for roads and boundaries, begin to be put over the words. This causes the map to be illegible. No options for better map overlays make the historic map becomes unusable for giving any detail. not already provided by the modern-day map. Having an overlay like the witches' icons for important places and cities would be beneficial for clarity.

In conjunction with the coloration problem of the map, the site provides no easy way to change color filtering for easier reading capabilities. The project does provide external resources to alleviate color correction problems. But, having to download resources from outside resources faces its own set of problems. A great way to eliminate part of this issue would be to include something akin to a dark mode. This would allow for an easier experience for viewers that rely on it. 

## Filters

</p>

Looking at the filters for the maps that the website provides there is a lack of searchability. Having different filters is useful but only eliminates so many search results. If there is a person that is being searched for, there is no way to look for where they are. Instead, everything must be known about this individual to narrow the search. With the large collection of recorded individuals present, this task becomes virtually impossible without having to sift through the whole map.

Continuing with the filters is the issue where they cannot be used in tandem with one another. From a historical perspective, gender and social class had a large influence on accusations of witchcraft. Having the ability to only select one filter at a time limits the capabilities to easily search for the group of people that the viewer is specifically interested in.

## User Accessibility

For non-English speakers, *Witches* doesn't have great text to speech options. It lacks language attributes for other languages, meaning text-to-speech software can't pronounce foreign languages correctly. Some words or phrases would then come off as odd or incomprehensible. Adding these language options would increase the available audience.

For those without mouses, keyboard controls are present but not well integrated. The interactive map works well basic key functions. But, when switching from the map to the filters or tabs, it doesn't always work properly. Getting stuck scrolling on the map is possible and requires a page refresh to fix. Better switching capabilities between the map and other features would be beneficial.

## Final Remarks

*Witches* is a beautifully crafted dh project presenting an interesting and explorative way to discover the history of the witch trials. The site is not perfect and does have issues that need fixing to craft a better experience. Yet, it accomplishes what it wants to do in an explorative and ingenuous way that helps to spread knowledge that people may have otherwise never learned.
