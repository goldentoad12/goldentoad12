# Review: *Witches*

Project: Witches

Project Director(s): Ewan McAndrews

Project URL: <https://witches.is.ed.ac.uk/>

Pulling from Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database, *Witches* is an online interactive website that allows its viewers to explore the Scottish region and see where people were accused of being "witches" and some basic information of them. This site provides many different filters ranging from economic class to the job these people had. To add further context, it provides both a modern and historical map to help and identify some places that may no longer be in existence. Many different accessibility options are included ranging from text resizing, voice commands, and keyboard controls.

One glaring issue from its beginning comes with the self-identification of the website. *Witches*, as the name implies, gives historical data and graphic representation on accused witches, with the drawback being that it doesn't explicitly specify the area in which the witches it presents are located. Seeing as people accused of witchcraft come from all over the world, when opening the page only a small section of the world map has the accused marked. It isn't until reaching the reference page that it becomes apparent that the project solely focuses on the people of Scotland. Given access to the entire world map and the non-specificity of the project's intentions, the work can initially be seen as underwhelming in its scope and not entirely completed.

The map provided with the project give rise to other problems with accessibility and ease of viewing. The modern-day map provided does provide legible and distinct from the background; however, the same can't be said for the historical map provided. It is a topographical map, most likely from the late 1800s (not specifically specified), that has very muted colors for both the text and the background. The further you zoom in, the worse this problem gets as more lines begin to be put over the words. This causes the map to be illegible. With no options for better map overlays to make the writing visible, the historic map becomes unusable for giving any detail that the modern day map doesnt already give.

Looking at the filters for the maps that the website provides, there is a glaring issue, the lack of searchability. The offering of different filters to narrow down the large group of individuals is helpful, but can still leave the user with a substantial amount of people to comb through. If there is a person that is wanting to be specifically searched for, their is no way to look for their name specifically and see where they are. Instead, everything must be known about this individual in order to elimanate as many people as possible to then start randomly searching for the specific individual wanted. With the large collection of recorded individuals present, this task becomes virtually impossible without having to sift through the whole map.

### To Do
-Page html elements do not have a language attribute (text to speech can't pronounce certain words correctly in other languages)
-Some areas are color coordinated but don’t give an option on the website to change the colors (gives links to other websites that can change the computer's system colors)
-Can’t be navigated solely through keyboard use
