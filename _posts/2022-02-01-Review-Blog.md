# Review: *Witches*


Pulling from Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database, *Witches* is an online interactive DH project that allows its viewers to explore the Scottish region and see where people were accused of being "witches" and some basic information of them. This project consist of a large map with icons of "witches" that can be clicked on to view basic information on these people. This site provides many different filters for interacting with these icons; ranging from economic class to the job these people had. To add further context, it provides both a modern and historical map to help and identify some places that may no longer be in existence. Many different accessibility options are included ranging from text resizing, voice commands, and keyboard controls.


## Presentation

One glaring issue from its beginning comes with the self-identification of the website. *Witches*, as the name implies, gives historical data and graphic representation on accused witches, with the drawback being that it doesn't explicitly specify the area in which the witches it presents are located. Seeing as people accused of witchcraft come from all over the world, when opening the page only a small section of the world map has the accused marked. It isn't until reaching the reference page that it becomes apparent that the project solely focuses on the people of Scotland. Given access to the entire world map and the non-specificity of the project's intentions, the work can initially be seen as underwhelming in its scope and not entirely completed. 


### Maps

<br> The map provided with the project give rise to other problems with accessibility and ease of viewing. The modern-day map provided does provide is legible and distinct from the background; however, the same can't be said for the historical map provided. It is a topographical map, most likely from the late 1800s (not specifically specified), that has very muted colors for both the text and the background. The further you zoom in, the worse this problem gets as more lines, for roads and boundaries, begin to be put over the words. This causes the map to be illegible. With no options for better map overlays to make the writing visible, the historic map becomes unusable for giving any detail not already provided by the modern-day map. Having some overlay similar to the witches' icons but for the names of important places and cities would be beneficial for easier navigation of historical map.

In conjunction with the coloration problem of the map, the site provides no easy way to change color filtering for easier reading capabilities. To its credit, the project provides external resources that can help alleviate with color correction problems. However, having to download resources from outside resources faces its own set of problems. A great way to eliminate part of this issue would be to include something akin to a dark mode to allow for an easier experience for the viewer.


## Filters

</p>
  
Looking at the filters for the maps that the website provides, there is a glaring issue, the lack of searchability. The offering of different filters to narrow down the large group of individuals is helpful, but can still leave the user with a substantial amount of people to comb through. If there is a person that is wanting to be specifically searched for, there is no way to look for their name specifically and see where they are. Instead, everything must be known about this individual in order to eliminate as many people as possible to then start randomly searching for the specific individual wanted. With the large collection of recorded individuals present, this task becomes virtually impossible without having to sift through the whole map.

Continuing with the filters is the issue where they cannot be used in tandem with one another. From a historical perspective, gender and social class had a large influence on the treatment and accusation of being a witch. Having the ability to only select one filter at a time limits the capabilities to easily search for the group of people that the viewer is specifically interested in.

## User Accessibility

This dh project works well in accommodating English speaking people with vision challenges; however, the same cannot be said for those who speak other languages. As stated in the accessibility tab, "Page html elements do not have a language attribute," meaning that certain sounds that aren't present in English but are common in other languages are not accommodated. This can make some foreign words sound incorrect or completely incomprehensible in other languages.

Another minor issue that arises is that while keyboard controls are present, their integration with the map is not as solid as would be expected. Solely using the keyboard with no mouse, it was at times possible to be stuck on the map continuously scrolling when the filters were attempted to be reached or vice versa. Although this is a minor issue at best, for some viewers it has the potential to make the site unusable.

## Final Remarks

*Witches* is a beautifully crafted dh project presenting an interesting and explorative way to discover the history of the witch trials and the people in which they affected. The site is not perfect and does have issues that need to be resolved in order to craft a better experience. However, despite this reality, it accomplishes what it wants to do in an exploratative and ingenuous way that helps to spread knowledge that people may have otherwise never learned.
